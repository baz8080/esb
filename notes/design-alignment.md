# Aligning the design language with uisce

2026-08-26. The owner reviewed both home pages side by side and picked a winner
per element, so the two sites read as one product before the same language is
applied to lifts. What esb absorbed:

- **Banner** takes uisce's format: `**August 2026 so far:** 978 faults and
  1,122 planned outages` — the bold month-and-colon prefix, the long month
  name, and " so far" only while the viewed month is still collecting
  (`D.observed_iso` month == viewed month). The old trailing "in Aug 2026" and
  the all-bold single `<strong>` went with it.
- **National heading** takes uisce's format: "The national picture in August
  2026", filled per month, replacing the static "Nationally this month" which
  read wrong on every past month.
- **Footer**: "How the grade is worked out" and "The other figure: Customer
  Minutes Lost" merged into one disclosure, "How these numbers are worked out",
  and every disclosure was tightened for a lay reader — the measured detail
  (1,460-outage back-dating check, 8 revisions, the 30-minute poll mechanics)
  lives in `notes/grading.md`, not the page. The final line is now the shared
  format: "Source code · not affiliated with ESB Networks or the CRU."
- **The horizon left the footer** — an owner decision, reversing the earlier
  "the exact horizon stays in the footer" note. "Built twice daily … Data to
  Wed 26 Aug, 06:04 UTC." was removed; the age chip stays, and the exact
  horizon survives as the chip's hover `title` and, in full, in each county
  page's sub line (which is a cold-entry surface and keeps its no-JS text).
- **Search behaviour moved upstream** to statusui (`searchHits`/`bindSearch`);
  this page keeps only the markup, the index build and the pick handler. uisce
  gets the same box in place of its sort control.
- `site.css` shrank: `--row-cols`/`--stats-cols` (identical to base),
  `.stats .cml` and the mobile legend-order override all moved into (or were
  already in) statusui's base.css, because uisce wanted the same values.

esb's own layout was the reference for the county rows (chevron, two-line
percentage stat, right-aligned counts) and the county-page card
(legend → tall bar → tiles), so nothing changed here on those.
